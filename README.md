📊 Data Analytics: E-Commerce Sales Insights
Welcome to the Data Analytics repository!
This project provides in-depth exploratory data analysis (EDA) and business intelligence insights for an e-commerce dataset using Python and SQL.

🚀 Project Overview
E-commerce companies collect vast amounts of data daily. This project demonstrates how to turn raw transactional data into actionable business insights by:

Cleaning and preparing data for analysis
Conducting descriptive and diagnostic analytics
Visualizing key trends and KPIs
Using SQL queries for advanced data exploration

🧰 Tools & Technologies
Jupyter Notebook: Interactive data analysis and visualization
Python: Data manipulation and visualization (pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, etc.)
SQL: Data extraction and transformation
Libraries: NumPy, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, sqlite3.
